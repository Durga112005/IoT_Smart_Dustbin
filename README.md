# IoT Smart Dustbin üöÆ‚ú®

This project implements a *Smart Dustbin using IoT with Arduino* for *smart waste management* in homes, schools, and public places.

The system uses *ultrasonic sensing* to detect user proximity and *automatically opens the lid, along with **fill-level monitoring* to notify when the dustbin is full.

## ü™ê Working Principle

1Ô∏è‚É£ The *ultrasonic sensor detects hand presence* near the dustbin.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ The *servo motor opens the lid automatically* when a hand is detected.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ The ultrasonic sensor also measures *fill level* of the dustbin to indicate when it is full.
